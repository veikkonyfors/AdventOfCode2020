# Advent of Code 2020

This repository holds solutions of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/ "Advent of Code programming puzzles") 2020 puzzles for Android in Kotlin.  
Maintained by Android Studio Chipmunk | 2021.2.1

## Introduction

Each sample solution is located in app subdirectory in it's own subdirectory named with prefix of advent2020.  
I would very much like to have the structure without the app sub directory, but unfortunately I haven't figured it out so far how to do it and still have all the solutions on single Android Studio project.
If someone knows how to do it, please give me a hint. Thank You!

Day 1 I did with Kotlin Playground, thus no solution here.
