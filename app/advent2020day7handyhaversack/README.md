# Advent of Code 2020 day 7, Handy Haversacks

Solution for day's both puzzles.

Refactoring package to day 6 caused a problem with R not found in import. Needed to put day 7 
on import of R in HandyHaversackActivity.
The same goes with running the app, name in the run dropdown is advent2020day7handyhaversack.
Didn't find out how to cure those.

One needs to store puzzle input into File(applicationContext.filesDir, "bagrules.txt").
